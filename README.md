    <h1>Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection</h1>
    <h2>To analyse the credit card fraud and predict the Fraud Transaction</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Credit card fraud detection refers to the process of identifying unauthorized or suspicious transactions made using stolen or compromised credit card information. Banks, financial institutions, and payment processors</p>
    <h3>Dataset belongs to kaggle.com - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data</h3>
    <h4>Library Used</h4>
    <p>1- Numpy</p>
    <p>2- Pandas</p>
    <p>3- Seaborn</p>
    <p>4- Matplotlib</p>
    <p>5- Sci-kit Learn</p>
    <h3>Project Structure</h3>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Data collection and cleaning-</b> Data is collected from Kaggle.com. Data is cleaned by removing unwanted columns  </p>
    <p><b>EDA-</b> Understand the pattern and trends</p>
    <p><b>Imbalance Dataset-</b> Data is Highly Imbalance, So we do Under Sampling and Over Sampling with Smote</p>
    <p><b>Split Data into Training and Test Set-</b> Split Data into training and test set for Model training and Evaluation</p>
    <p><b>ML model training</b> Using logistic regression Random Forest classifier and Decision treee classifier</p>
    <p><b>Calculate F1 funcction accuracy score recall score</b> use this matrics to evaluate the performance of the model</p>
    p><b>Visualize the model</b> Visulaize the model using the Evaluated result for better understanding</p>
    <h3>Business Uses</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Traditional rule-based systems often generate high false positive rates, leading to legitimate transactions being blocked (e.g., customers traveling abroad).</p>
    <p> ML models that learn individual spending behaviors reduce these false positives by better understanding customer patterns.</p>
